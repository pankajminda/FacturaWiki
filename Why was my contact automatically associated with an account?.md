# Why was my contact automatically associated with an account?

When you add a contact and enter the Company Name, the contact is instantly associated with an account with the same company name. If an account that matches the contact’s company name isn’t found, a new one is created. The contact is linked to that account and is featured as the account’s related contact. 

You can associate a contact to an account,
Via Import
During lead conversion
From the Add/Edit Contact form
